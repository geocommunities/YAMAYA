# YAMAYA

A minimalist, modern operating system for the 21st century.  
Inspired by the simplicity of DOS, but built from the ground up for 2025+ hardware. No legacy bloat, no SATA, just clean, modular design.

## Goals

- Boot from USB-C devices via UEFI
- Simple text-based shell interface
- FAT32 file system support initially, with plans for custom FS
- Modular drivers: USB HID, storage, display
- Expandable with features added only when truly needed
- Designed for both real hardware and emulators (QEMU)

## Current Status

- Project scaffolding created
- Minimal kernel that prints a welcome message to screen
- Bootable ISO setup via GRUB

## How to Contribute

Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests! We welcome help with:

- USB driver development
- File system implementation
- Shell enhancements
- App loader and runtime
